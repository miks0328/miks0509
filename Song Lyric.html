            <h1>Tongue Tied</h1>
            <p>Bright cold silver moon<br>
                Tonight alone in my room<br>
                You were here just yesterday<br>
                Slight turn of a head<br>
                Eyes down when you said<br>
                I guess I need my life to change<br>
                Seems like some things just aren't the same<br>
                <br>What could I say</br>
                
                I need a little more luck than a little bit<br>
                Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit<br>
                And every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
                I need a little good luck to get me by<br>
                I need a little more help than a little bit<br>
                Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet<br>
                Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
                <br>I need a little good luck to get me by this time</br>
                
                I stare up at the stars<br>
                I wonder just where you are<br>
                (I wonder just where you are)<br>
                Was it something I said<br>
                Or something I never did<br>
                Or was I always in the way<br>
                (Was it something I did)<br>
                Can someone tell me what to say<br>
                <br>To just make you stay</br>

                I need a little more luck than a little bit<br>
                Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit<br>
                And every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
                I need a little good luck to get me by<br>
                I need a little more help than a little bit<br>
                Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet<br>
                Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
                <br>I need a little good luck to get me by this time<br>

                Now it feels like the end<br>
                Don't wanna be here again<br>
                And we could help each other<br>
                Off the ground so we never fall down again<br>
                And what it takes I don't care<br>
                We're gonna make it I swear<br>
                And we could help each other<br>
                <br>Off the ground so we never fall down again<br>
                
                
                I need a little more luck than a little bit<br>
                Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit<br>
                I need a little good luck to get me by<br>
                I need a little more help than a little bit<br>
                Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet<br>
                Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
                I need a little good luck to get me by this time</br>
