       <h1>Tongue Tied</h1>
       <P>Bright cold silver moon
         Tonight alone in my room<br>
         You were here just yesterday<br>
         Slight turn of a head<br>
         Eyes down when you said<br>
         I guess I need my life to change<br>
         Seems like some things just aren't the same<br>
         What could I say<br>

        I need a little more luck than a little bit<br>
        Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit<br>
        And every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
        I need a little good luck to get me by<br>
        I need a little more help than a little bit<br>
        Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet<br>
        Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
        I need a little good luck to get me by this time<br>

        I stare up at the stars<br> 
        I wonder just where you are<br>
        You feel a million miles away<br>
        I wonder just where you are<br>
        Was it something I said<br>
        Or something I never did<br>
        Or was I always in the way<br>
        Was it something I did<br>
        Can someone tell me what to say<br>
        To just make you stay<br>

        I need a little more luck than a little bit<br>
        Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit<br>
        And every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
        I need a little good luck to get me by<br>
        I need a little more help than a little bit<br>
        Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet<br>
        Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
        I need a little good luck to get me by this time<br>

        Now it feels like the end<br>
        Don't wanna be here again<br>
        And we could help each other<br>
        Off the ground so we never fall down again<br>
        And what it takes I don't care<br>
        We're gonna make it I swear<br>
        And we could help each other<br>
        Off the ground so we never fall down again Again<br>

        I need a little more luck than a little bit<br>
        Cause every time I get stuck the words won't fit<br>
        But every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
        I need a little good luck to get me by<br>
        I need a little more help than a little bit<br>
        Like a perfect one word no one's heard yet<br>
        Cause every time that I try I get tongue tied<br>
        I need a little good luck to get me by this time<br>

        Now it feels like the end<br>
        Don't wanna be here again<br>
        And we could help each other<br>
        Off the ground so we never fall down again<br>
        And what it takes I don't care<br>
        We're gonna make it I swear<br>
        And we could help each other<br>
        Off the ground so we never fall down again</P>
